# Experiment 1: Implementation of Data Charts using R

## Author

* **Name:** SIJU N
* **Roll Number:** 23BAD115

## Objective

To analyze and visualize student academic performance using **R programming** by implementing **bar charts, line charts, and pie charts**.

---

## Experiment Description

This experiment focuses on analyzing internal assessment data of students across different subjects. The dataset includes marks obtained in **Internal Test 1**, **Internal Test 2**, and **Final Grades**.
Average internal marks are computed to compare subject-wise performance and to study performance trends using appropriate visualizations.

## Tools and Libraries Used

* R Language
* RStudio
* ggplot2
* dplyr
* tidyr

---

## Dataset Details

* **Dataset Name:** `1.student_performance.csv`

### Attributes Included

* Subject
* Internal_Test1
* Internal_Test2
* Final_Grade

---

## Steps Performed

1. Loaded the required R libraries for data manipulation and visualization.
2. Imported the student performance dataset using `read.csv()`.
3. Examined the structure and summary of the dataset.
4. Calculated average internal marks for each student.
5. Computed subject-wise average internal marks.
6. Created a bar chart to visualize subject-wise average internal marks.
7. Generated a line chart to analyze performance trends across internal tests.
8. Calculated grade distribution percentages.
9. Created a pie chart to visualize the final grade distribution.

## Outputs Generated

* Bar chart showing subject-wise average internal marks
* Line chart illustrating performance trends across Internal Test 1 and Internal Test 2
* Pie chart representing final grade distribution

---

## Observations

* Subject-wise variations in student performance are clearly observable.
* Line charts effectively highlight performance trends across internal assessments.
* Pie charts provide a clear and concise overview of grade distribution among students.

---

## Conclusion

This experiment demonstrates the significance of **data visualization** in analyzing academic performance. Using R and graphical techniques enables better understanding of subject-wise strengths and weaknesses, identification of performance trends, and supports data-driven academic decision-making.
